MLogitTools
===========

This is a group of `R` functions that I use for post-estimation analysis of `mlogit` objects. There are currently two functions:
  - `utilities.mlogit()` pulls the utility equations from an estimated `mlogit` object.
  - `compute.Utility()` uses the utility equations to compute the expected utility and probability of selection for each alternative.
